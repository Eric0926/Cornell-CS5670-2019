    Given a set of images taken from the same viewpoint and a corresponding set
    of directions for light sources, this function computes the albedo and
    normal map of a Lambertian scene.

    If the computed albedo for a pixel has an L2 norm less than 1e-7, then set
    the albedo to black and set the normal to the 0 vector.

    Normals should be unit vectors.

def preprocess_ncc_impl(image, ncc_size):
    """
    Prepare normalized patch vectors according to normalized cross
    correlation.

    This is a preprocessing step for the NCC pipeline.  It is expected that
    'preprocess_ncc' is called on every input image to preprocess the NCC
    vectors and then 'compute_ncc' is called to compute the dot product
    between these vectors in two images.

    NCC preprocessing has two steps.
    (1) Compute and subtract the mean.
    (2) Normalize the vector.

    The mean is per channel.  i.e. For an RGB image, over the ncc_size**2
    patch, compute the R, G, and B means separately.  The normalization
    is over all channels.  i.e. For an RGB image, after subtracting out the
    RGB mean, compute the norm over the entire (ncc_size**2 * channels)
    vector and divide.

    If the norm of the vector is < 1e-6, then set the entire vector for that
    patch to zero.

    Patches that extend past the boundary of the input image at all should be
    considered zero.  Their entire vector should be set to 0.

    Patches are to be flattened into vectors with the default numpy row
    major order.  For example, given the following
    2 (height) x 2 (width) x 2 (channels) patch, here is how the output
    vector should be arranged.

    channel1         channel2
